    <p>As I begin my professional career, I position myself as the combination of a strategic ecologist and a scenario builder. The strategic ecologist refers to a designer who frames landscape design through a dynamic lens and uses highly organized strategic configuration to reveal design possibilities and performances. Landscape is not a static composition or just beautiful scenes. The masterâ€™s education from Auburn University inspires me to explore the dynamics and richness of landscape with more rigor. I regard landscape as the continuing discourse which aims to unpack the ongoing flux and process of an interactive whole. With these regards, unfolding the constant changes of landscape needs the legible representation medium and skills provided by the scenario builder. The ideas of strategic ecologist and scenario builder, therefore, has profoundly guided my design direction. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The fundamental understanding that I gained in my undergraduate study emphasized functional and cultural aspects of landscape. I have continued to develop and incorporate this reflection of cultural and social ecology through my design process. Most of my studio projects are in an urban context. I feel confident in researching and designing in urban settings as the combination of strategic ecologist and scenario builder. My previous internships in both architecture and landscape firms have also expanded my vision of the multi-disciplinary engagement. </p>
