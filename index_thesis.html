  <h1>Process-Based Design</h1>
  <h3>Master's Thesis, 2016</h3>
  <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
  <article>
    <p>Landscape designs, nowadays, are commonly presented as compelling visions, both in real projects and conceptual designs. By the end of the deadline, people will be able to experience the new environment as the visions promised. In this type of plan for the environment, the design approach is most likely to have static outcomes, and to miss dynamic, complex, and rich qualities of the environment -- as McLuhan said “invisible environment.” </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Landscape’s dynamic qualities could be represented as the processes (visible and invisible) over time. In 1966, Marshall McLuhan wrote that “Environments are not just containers, but are processes that change the content totally.” Process-based design is the approach that explores and is inspired by these environmental processes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Process-based design can offer a noticeable advantage in terms of time management. It thus can contribute to other related aspects, such as economy and social fabric enhancement. Further, process-based design as the product of revealing the time and culture of the environment is capable of highlighting the time sequence of the environment. It generates the wider dialogue for the public to engage with the timeline of the space. From the historical signifi cance to the future revolutions, this design approach offers the public opportunities to witness and understand every transitional moments and process.</p>
